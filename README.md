# ACF Seamless

This plugin will [restore the seamless style](https://github.com/AdvancedCustomFields/acf/issues/193#issuecomment-501916061) to ACF Field Groups when using the Gutenberg editor.

By default ACF will display Field Groups with the standard WP metabox styling when using the Gutenberg editor.
